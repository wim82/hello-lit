### Hello Lit

This is a small application to show off how lit-html works, and demonstrate the core directives of lit-html without adding much boilerplate, builds, node ...

However, it *is* needed to run it on a webserver rather than from the filesystem because of importing modules.
I recommend `liteserver` for ease of use: `npm install liteserver -g` and execute the `liteserver` command in this directory.

Once up and running, check the slides folder (yes, just read the code), and match it with the menu item on the navigation bar. This will show you the result of what the code is doing.

#### Improvements
If I find the time to show the .js files next to the demo and make it executable, that would be even nicer. Or move the whole thing to a codepen.
